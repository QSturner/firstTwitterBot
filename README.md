# firstTwitterBot
A bot created for use on [twitter.com](https://twitter.com/), developed by Quentin Sturner

## Overview
As the heading and name of the repository states, this is my first ever Twitter bot, created with node.js. This bot is very simple and barebones because it was meant to be for me just dipping my toes into the world of Twitter bot development.

I followed a tutorial on YouTube to complete this bot. Since I am updating this file 3 years after I completed this project, I no longer have the link to said video.

## Features
This bot is able to:
1. Search recent tweets that contain the hashtag "#nodejs" and like the first tweet in tne list
2. Use the same parameters as above and follow the user who posted the first tweet in the list
